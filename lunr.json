Tags It provides following two tags which can grab the swagger schema from a local or remote location and create beautiful and easy to read documents. swagger_ui - This tag generates swagger ui from the swagger schema. swagger_to_html - This tag generates a simple and clean user interface that contains all the useful information present in the swagger specification with examples. Decorators The theme also provides features to decorate/modify the swagger spec before using it.A use case that can explain the rationale behind this feature is, sometime we might want to modify the swagger and remove some endpoints from being exposed in the documentation. Decorators provided by the theme: Excluding Definitions You can add an x-doc object with exclude: true property to remove spec definitions/objects from being processed.The flag can be added in the following places. Excluding path - To remove a complete path from the spec add the x-doc object to that path. For instance, to remove /pets from the following sample schema. 1 2 3 4 5 swagger: \"2.0\" paths: /pets: x-doc: exclude: true Excluding operation - To remove an operation from the spec you can add an x-doc object to that operation.
